        <p>Many courses in machine intelligence often cover backpropagation for feedforward
networks, and claim that a similar approach can be applied to convolutional
networks without any additional justification. Here, I methodically derive
backpropagation for convolutional networks. The notation used and general
structure of this post is similar to <a href="https://mananshah99.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/backprop/">my derivation of backpropagation for
feedforward networks</a>,
which functions as an excellent introduction to backpropagation if the reader is
not familiar with such concepts.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction and Motivation</h2>

<p>Consider a dataset of images of handwritten digits $x$ and associated digit
values $y$. Since we’re now dealing with multimensional images as input instead
of a single-dimensional set of features, one solution is to “flatten” each $l
\times w \times h$ image into an $lwh$-length input array for a feedfoward
network. While such a pipeline would <em>work</em> and provide reasonable results
<a class="citation" href="#de2015comparison">(De Chazal et al., 2015)</a>, it treats each pixel of the image as independent
and destroys structural features, significantly diminishing prediction quality.</p>

<p>Convolutional networks, proposed in <a class="citation" href="#lecun1999object">(LeCun et al., 1999)</a> and popularized
by <a class="citation" href="#krizhevsky2012imagenet">(Krizhevsky et al., 2012)</a>, provide a powerful way to train networks
with desirable inductive biases for image classification problems. In
particular, convolutional networks employ three basic ideas—local receptive
fields, shared weights, and pooling—to preserve and utilize structural
features for prediction. We’ll discuss each in turn, developing intuition 
for the structure of a convolutional network in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Local receptive fields</strong>. While feedforward networks consist of a single layer
of input nodes that are fully connected to hidden layer nodes, convolutional
networks treat the input as a multidimensional array and connect hidden nodes to
a small region of the input nodes (as illustrated in Figure 1). This small
region of nodes, called the <em>local receptive field</em> of a node in the subsequent
layer, is slid across the input layer, with each new field connecting to a new
output node. As in feedforward networks, each connection learns a weight, and
each hidden node learns a bias as well.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/conv_hidden.png" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 1.</span> Diagram of local receptive
        fields in a convolutional network (in two dimensions). Each node in layer
        $l + 1$ only connects to a local region of nodes in layer $l$. As the
        local region of nodes is slide across the nodes in layer $l$, the corresponding
        node it is connected to in layer $l+1$ changes, as in the blue and red 
        examples.
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Shared weights</strong>. Now that we understand connections as they relate to local
receptive fields in convolutional networks, we can introduce the concept of
shared weights. While the general form of Figure 1 allows each connection
to learn its own weight, convolutional networks impose the constraint that
all nodes in layer $l + 1$ share the same weights and bias. In Figure 1, 
this implies that the $j, k$th hidden node has output</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a^{l+1}_{j, k} = \sigma \left( \sum_{a = 0}^1 \sum_{b = 0}^1 w^{l+1}_{a, b} a^l_{j + a, k + b} + b^{l+1} \right)</script>

<p>where $w^{l+1}$ is the shared weight matrix, $a^l$ defines the input activations
from layer $l$ to layer $l + 1$, and $b^{l+1}$ is the shared bias for layer $l$.
This output equation is the exact same as that of convolutional networks, but
altered to share weights and only use information from a node’s local receptive
field. It turns out that the output equation is <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2017/02/24/cnns/">identical to that of a discrete
convolution</a>, which gives
convolutional networks their name.</p>

<p>Shared weights (also called “feature maps” or “filters”) are useful because they
allow all nodes in a given hidden layer to detect the same input pattern
(perhaps an edge in the image, or a particular kind of shape) at different areas
of the input image. As a result, convolutional networks preserve structural and
translational invariance of images.</p>

<p>While our current network in Figure 1 only allows layer $l + 1$ to learn one set
of shared weights (one feature map), convolutional networks often employ
multiple sets of feature maps per layer as in Figure 2. This allows for more
expressive power per layer; the multiple outputs produced are concatenated along
a new dimension and passed as input to the next hidden layer.</p>

    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 2.</span> Diagram of shared weights
        and multiple feature maps in a convolutional network. The thinner blue
        and red lines represent weights from the first feature map (with one set
        of shared weights and bias), producing the top output in layer $l+1$. Likewise, 
        the thicker blue and red lines represent weights from the second feature map (with
        a seocnd set of shared weights and bias), producing
        the bottom output in layer $l+1$. These outputs are stacked along a third
        axis and passed as input to layer $l + 2$; the nodes in layer $l + 2$
        have receptive fields that operate (sum over) over all input dimensions.
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Pooling layers</strong>. Convolutional networks additionally employ pooling layers to
reduce the number of nodes involved as the network grows deeper. Pooling layers
are quite simple: they subsample blocks of nodes from a layer to produce a
single output, reducing the size of the layer as output. The most common
pooling operation is called maximum pooling, which selects the maximum value
of its input nodes for its output (as in Figure 3).</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/max_pool.png" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 3.</span> Diagram of a maximum pooling
        layer operating on $2 \times 2$ segments of an image, where the blue
        nodes are are those with the maximum value. Other pooling operations
        are possible, although maximum pooling is most widely used.
    </div>
</div>

<p>Convolutional networks utilize a combination of local receptive fields, shared
weights, and pooling layers to define their architectures. In particular,
canonical architectures consist of an input layer followed by some number
of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by some number of fully connected
layers, followed by an output layer. General architectural patterns along with
samples are located <a href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="forward-propagation">Forward Propagation</h2>

<p>With our knowledge of convolutional network architectures, we can precisely
define forward propagation.</p>

<p><strong>Convolutional Layers</strong>. Here, we consider convolutional layers (which utilize
local receptive fields and shared weights) along three dimensions with multiple
feature maps, as most images are three-dimensional and learning multiple feature
maps from an input produces a three-dimensional output. However, there are
obvious generalizations of our discussion to higher (or lower)-dimensional
networks.</p>

<p>Let the input to our convolutional layer be $\mathbf{a}^{l - 1} \in
\mathbf{R}^{r \times s \times t}$, and let feature map $m$ (of $M$ total) be
parameterized as $\mathbf{w}^{l, m} \in \mathbf{R}^{d \times d \times t}$,
where the third dimension of the feature map matches the third dimension of the
input. The weighted output of our convolutional layer is $\mathbf{z}^l \in
\mathbf{R}^{(r - d + 1) \times (s - d + 1) \times M}$. We can write the weighted
output for feature map $m$ as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">z^{l}_{i, j, m} = \sum_{a = 0}^{d-1} \sum_{b = 0}^{d-1} \sum_{c = 0}^{t - 1} w^{l, m}_{a, b, c} a^{l-1}_{(i + a), (j + b), c} + b^{l,m}</script>

<p>which is effectively a Hadamard product between the (shared) weight matrix and
the relevant slice of the input nodes. The activations are thus</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a^{l}_{i, j, m} = \sigma (z_{i, j, m}^{l})</script>

<p>for some nonlinearlity $\sigma (\cdot )$.</p>

<p><strong>(Maximum) Pooling Layers</strong>. Maximum pooling layers are quite straightforward;
they only select the largest value within each $k \times k$ region in an input,
and output the resulting layer with reduced size.</p>

<p>That’s it! Let’s now move on to deriving the backpropagation rules for these
layer updates. We’ll follow a similar procedure to the derivation for feedfoward
networks <a href="https://mananshah99.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/backprop/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backward-propagation">Backward Propagation</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to obtain an output from our network, the next step is to
update the parameters (weights and biases) of the network to yield a desirable
output as per the loss function $\mathcal{L}$.</p>

<p><strong>Convolutional Layers.</strong> Let’s start by computing partials of the loss function
with respect to the network weights and biases. For weight $w^{l, m}_{a, b, c}$
at layer $l$ in feature map $m$ and bias $b^l$, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{w^{l, m}_{a,b,c}} &= \sum_{i = 0}^{r
  - d} \sum_{j = 0}^{s - d} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}
  \frac{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}{\partial w^{l, m}_{a,b,c}}  \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{b^{l, m}} &= \sum_{i = 0}^{r
  - d} \sum_{j = 0}^{s - d} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}
  \frac{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}{\partial b^{l, m}}   
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>where we assume $w$ is a $d \times d \times t$ feature map and layer $l$ has
dimensions $r \times s \times t$. The summations are involved as we must sum
over all weighted output expressions that contain $w^{l, m}_{a,b,c}$—this
corresponds to weight sharing in the convolutional network.</p>

<p>Since we have an explicit relationship between $z_{i,j, m}^l$ and $w_{a,b,c}^{l,m}$,
we can write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{w^{l, m}_{a,b,c}} = \sum_{i = 0}^{r
  - d} \sum_{j = 0}^{s - d} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}
  a^{l-1}_{(i + a), (j + b), c} }</script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{b^{l, m}} = \sum_{i = 0}^{r
  - d} \sum_{j = 0}^{s - d} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l}}</script>

<p>In both cases, we’ll need to compute $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial
z_{i,j,m}^l}$. We can express</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l} = \frac{\partial
\mathcal{L}}{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l} \frac{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l}{\partial
z_{i,j,m}^l}</script>

<p>where we take the partial with respect to $a_{i,j,m}^l$ as $a_{i,j,m}^l =
\sigma(z_{i,j,m}^l)$. Since we have an explicit relationship between $a_{i,j,m}^l$
and $a_{i,j,m}^l$, we can write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{i,j,m}^l} =  \frac{\partial
\mathcal{L}}{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l} \sigma'(z_{i,j,m}^l)
}</script>

<p>Finally, we have to deal with the $\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial
a_{i,j,m}^l$ term; this is where the “backpropagation” term comes into play.
For the final layer in the network, we can analytically compute this term
as $\mathcal{L}$ is a function of the activations of the last layer. For all
other layers, we have that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l} = \sum_{a = 0}^{d'-1} \sum_{b =
0}^{d'-1} \sum_{k = 0}^K \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_{(i-a),(j-b),k}^{l+1}} \frac{\partial
z_{(i-a),(j-b),k}^{l+1}}{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l}</script>

<p>where we assume $w^{l+1}$ is a $d’ \times d’ \times M$ feature map and layer
$l+1$ uses $K$ feature maps. Since we have an explicit relationship between
$z_{(i-a),(j-b),k}^{l+1}$ and $a_{i,j,m}^l$, we can write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a_{i,j,m}^l} = \sum_{a = 0}^{d'-1}
\sum_{b = 0}^{d'-1} \sum_{k = 0}^K \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial
z_{(i-a),(j-b),k}^{l+1}} w_{a, b, m}^{l+1, k}
}</script>

<p>which has an intuitive interpretation of propagating backward the errors of
nodes in layer $l + 1$ that have connections to node $(i, j, m)$ in layer $l$.
Since we can compute $\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial z_{(i-a),(j-b),k}^{l+1}$,
and since every layer’s partials depend on the layer after it, all that’s left
to do is sequentially iterate backward through the network, computing partials
as we go—hence, backward propagation.</p>

<p><strong>(Maximum) Pooling Layers.</strong> Again, maximum pooling layers are straightforward;
since they don’t do any learning themselves and simply reduce the size of the
input in forward propagation, in backward propagation this single reduced value
acquires an error, and the error is forwarded back to the node it came from
(these errors are quite sparse). This is typically accomplished by storing
“sentinel” values that remember which node was chosen in the forward propagation
step of maximum pooling.</p>

<p>The backpropagation algorithm is now identical to the one presented in <a href="https://mananshah99.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/backprop/">the
derivation for feedforward
networks</a>, where we
first compute the partial derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the node
inputs and subsequently backpropage the error to the previous layer.</p>
