        <h2 id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction and Motivation</h2>

<p>Convolutional networks, architectured to preserve spatial information in inputs
through the use of local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling layers,
have been incredibly effective at learning representations from images and
performing classification/regression tasks. While such networks are excellent at
predicting a singular (or multiple) labels given an image, they are less suited
for tasks such as <em>semantic</em> or <em>instance segmentation</em>, in which the expected
output of an input image is a segmentation map highlighting different objects in
the image (as in Figure 1).</p>

<div class="figure">

    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 1.</span> An example of semantic
        segmentation, with input images at left and desired (segmented) outputs
        at right. Note that the semantic segmentation task does not require the
        output to differentiate between different members of the same class;
        all persons are highlighted the same color. Image due to <a class="citation" href="#kundu2016feature">(Kundu et al., 2016)</a>.

<p>An obvious method to approach semantic segmentation with convolutional networks
is with a sliding window; one can subsample a region of pixels around every
given input pixel, pass that region as input to a convolutional network, and
assign the prediction of the network to the input pixel’s location in the
segmentation map. Doing so for every input pixel would indeed work, but would be
incredibly computationally expensive, requiring one inference for each pixel.</p>

<p>Fully convolutional networks attempt to solve this problem by (a) replacing the
fully connected layers in traditional convolutional networks with equivalent
convolutional layers, and (b) introducing upsampling (transposed convolution)
layers to ensure that the output is the same size as the original image. While
<a class="citation" href="#long2015fully">(Long et al., 2015)</a> introduce and describe both such modifications in their
seminal work, the discussion is dense and leaves much to unpack—in this post,
we’ll take a deeper dive into understanding the reasoning and implementation of
fully convolutional networks.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-fully-connected-layers">Replacing Fully Connected Layers</h2>

<p>While convolutional and pooling layers preserve spatial information with respect
to the input, fully connected layers lose all such information by compressing
previous layer activations into a single set of fully connected nodes. This loss
of spatial information makes it impossible to create a one-to-one mapping
between input and output pixels in a network with fully connected layers.</p>

<p>However, we can note that the only difference between fully connected and
convolutional layers is that the neurons in a convolutional layer are only
connected to a local region of the input (<em>receptive fields</em>) and that neurons
associated with a feature map share parameters (<em>parameter sharing</em>).<sup id="fnref:a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:a" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Since the
neurons in fully connected and convolutional layers still compute dot products,
they share a functional form, and so it’s possible to convert between fully
connected and convolutional layers.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Precisely, we can convert fully connected layers to convolutional layers by
replacing a fully connected layer with a convolutional layer that has a
receptive field that spans all of the nodes in the previous convolutional layer.
For example, if convolutional layer $l-1$ operating on a $224 \times 224$ input
has output $[7 \times 7 \times 512]$ and is followed by 1000-dimensional fully
connected layer $l$, an equivalent reformulation would be to replace $l$ with a
convolutional layer with 1000 feature maps of size $d = 7$. Layer $l$ would
therefore produce output of size $[1 \times 1 \times 1000]$, as desired.</p>

<p>But how exactly would replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers
benefit us? Say we replaced the input of layer $l-1$ with a $384 \times 384$
image; if a $224 \times 224$ image gives a volume of size $[7 \times 7 \times
512]$ (a reduction by 32), a $384 \times 384$ image will give a volume of size
$[12 \times 12 \times 512]$ as $384/32 = 12$. While this would cause problems
for a fully connected layer $l$, our modified convolutional layer $l$ will have
an output of size $[6 \times 6 \times 1000]$ as $12 - 7 + 1 = 6$. As a result,
instead of a single vector of class scores of length 1000, we obtain a $6 \times
6$ array of class scores across the $384 \times 384$ input image. This array
corresponds to scores we would obtain were we to slide a $224 \times 224$ patch
across the $384 \times 384$ image in striids of 32 pixels—but we obtain it
in one forward pass!</p>

<h2 id="upsampling-with-transposed-convolutions">Upsampling with Transposed Convolutions</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve discussed the process of replacing fully connected layers with
their convolutional layer equivalents, thus preserving spatial information. We
can use this method directly to perform semantic segmentation: if all of the
convolutions in our network are <a href="https://machinelearning.wtf/terms/same-convolution/">same
convolutions</a> as opposed to
<a href="https://machinelearning.wtf/terms/valid-convolution/">valid convolutions</a>, our
convolutional layers all operate on the full size of the image, allowing us to
compute a pixel-wise mean squared error between the final output and the
segmentation ground truth. However, the computational cost of developing a model
only using same convolutions and never downsampling is incredibly high, making
such an approach infeasible.</p>

<p>If we allow convolutional layers to downsample their input, we require the
ability to upsample our outputs for final semantic segmentation. Traditional
convolutional layers can’t do this for us, as they can only preserve input size
or downsample. As a result, we’ll need a new tool to allow for upsampling.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Upsampling.</strong> Consider a network that consisted only of same
convolutions but downsampled with maximum pooling. An intuitive method to
perform upsampling for this network is to introduce layers that perform the
“opposite” of maximum pooling. Concretely, recall that maximum pooling selects
the largest value in partitioned patches of its input and produces an output
solely of those largest values, storing sentinels that record where the maximum
values originated from (for the purposes of backpropagation). Maximum unpooling
layers use the sentinels from their corresponding pooling layers to set the
corresponding values at their locations before pooling, and set the remaining
values to zero (see <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2020/lecture_12.pdf">slide
19</a> for a visualization).
Doing so is a reasonable attempt to “reverse” the pooling operations at later
stages in the network, producing a model as in Figure 2.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/max_pool_unpool.png" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 2.</span> An example of in-network upsampling.
        The colored layers represent pairs of maximum pooling/unpooling layers
        immediately followed by convolutions;
        the pooling/unpooling layers are responsible for changes in dimensionality, while all
        convolutions operate in same mode (and hence preserve dimensionality).
        The output shape is the same as the input shape, as desired.
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Learnable Upsampling.</strong> In-network upsampling provides a promising approach
for downsampling and upsampling within convolutional networks, but requires that
all convolutions operate in same mode, with changes in dimensionality only
occurring at pooling layers. It additionally defines a relatively simple
function for upsampling, using no learnable parameters. Learnable upsampling
provides a remedy for both of these approaches, defining a generalized layer
that can perform upsampling in a backpropagation-amenable manner.</p>

<p>Recall that, in a general sense, the convolution operation defines a weight
matrix $w$ which is multiplied with a patch of the same size from the input and
summed to produce a weighted output. Learnable upsampling performs a very
similar operation; it also defines a weight matrix $w$, but it instead performs
elementwise multiplication of $w$ with each input value and combines the
resulting outputs to produce a larger weighted output. This combination is
performed by specifying a “stride” value, which indicates how much the output
should be moved for each movement in the input; see Figure 3 for an example.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/transposed_conv.png" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 3.</span> An example of learnable
        upsampling due to <a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/20176">StackOverflow user andriys</a>.
        Here, the image is the input to the upsampling layer and the filter is the weight
        matrix $w$, which is elementwise multiplied with each input value and
        combined according to a certain stride.
    </div>
</div>

<p>Let’s look more closely at the learnable upsampling operation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the forward pass, this operation multiplies a single input value by a
weight matrix and tiles the output values according to a stride. This is
exactly what we do in the backward pass in a regular convolutional layer; we
multiply a gradient value with its weighted connections to the previous layer
to obtain the gradient of the previous layer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the backward pass, this operation will backpropagate gradients by
multiplying them with the weight matrix and summing contributions to arrive at
the gradient for each input value. But this is exactly what we do in the forward
pass of a regular convolutional layer; we elementwise multiply the weight matrix
with a patch of the input and sum the resulting values.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These insights make it incredibly easy to implement learnable upsampling: we
just switch the forward and backward passes of a normal convolution! So we can
now make sense of the phrase used in Section 3.3. of <a class="citation" href="#long2015fully">(Long et al., 2015)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upsampling is backwards strided convolution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, upsampling performs a “backwards” convolution according to a stride
that defines how the output is tiled for movement in the input.</p>

<p>What’s in a name? The learnable upsampling operation has many names in
literature, including deconvolution, upconvolution, fractionally strided
convolution, and backward strided convolution. Deconvolution is a rather
unfortunate name (as the upsampling layer doesn’t actually perform the
deconvolution operation), but has stuck around for historical reasons.
Upconvolution is used to refer to the fact that the output of a learnable
upsampling layer is larger than the input. Fractionally strided convlution is
used as strides often refer to how many input values are moved for every output
value in a convolution operation, so learnable upsampling employs fractional
strides (as multiple output values are moved for every input value).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Fully convolutional networks work due the (a) transformation of fully connected
layers to spatially-aware convolutional layers and (b) introduction of
(learnable) upsampling layers to allow for computational efficiency in producing
an output of same dimensions as the input. As a result of these adjustments,
such networks—true to their name—only use convolutional and pooling
operations, discarding fully connected layers entirely.</p>
