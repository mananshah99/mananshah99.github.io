        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A neural network computes a function on inputs $\mathbf{x}$ by performing a
series of computations propagating information from its inputs to an eventual
output $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$; this process is called <em>forward propagation</em>. The
error of the network’s output compared to the desired output $\mathbf{y}$ is
quantified by a loss function $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{y}, \hat{\mathbf{y}})$; this
error is subsequently allowed to flow backward through the network in the
<em>backward propagation</em> step to compute the gradients of all network parameters
with respect to the loss function.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Precisely, the backward propagation
(backpropagation) step is a method of computing gradients of network
parameters with respect to a specified loss function; gradient
descent is an example of a method that uses these computed gradients as part of
a learning paradigm.</p>

<p>The backpropagation algorithm coupled with the stochastic gradient descent
training paradigm has seen widespread success in learning numerous neural
network architectures; common explicit examples include the <a href="https://mananshah99.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/ffnn/">feedforward
network</a> and the
<a href="https://mananshah99.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/convnets/">convolutional
network</a>. While such
derivations provide necessary insight into the workings of such learning
algorithms, they ultimately provide narrow glimpses into the general
backpropagation framework and lose sight of the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>In this post, we build intution for, derive, and interpret the generalized
backpropagation algorithm. The resulting approach, resembling the current
methods adopted by popular machine intelligence libaries such as PyTorch and
Tensorflow, will enable generalized learning paradigms for a wide variety of
network structures (with certain constraints). The material covered in this post
is largely inspired and derived from Chapter 6.5 of <a class="citation" href="#goodfellow2016deep">(Goodfellow et al., 2016)</a>; the reader is recommended to refer to the chapter for more examples and
clarifying information where necessary.</p>

<h3 id="networks-as-computational-graphs">Networks as Computational Graphs</h3>

<p>It’s useful to formalize the computations performed in a neural network with
computational graph language by defining an explicit graph for each network. In
particular, each node in our graph will represent a variable (e.g. a scalar,
vector, matrix, tensor), and directed edges between nodes will represent
operations (functions of one or more variables) between nodes. Our graph will
only allow a fixed set of operations for clarity; more complicated functions can
be expressed as compositions of operations.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/comp_graph_ex.png" style="width: 30%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
    <div class="caption">
        <span class="caption-label">Figure 1.</span> An example computational
        graph representing $y = \sigma(w^Tx + b)$. Here, our set of operations
        includes the dot product, the sum operation, and the sigmoid nonlinearity.
        Note that while variables $u$ and $v$ were not included in our initial
        equation, they were required in our computational graph to conform to
        the provided operation set. 
    </div>
</div>

<p>This representation allows us to formally define and reason about operations on
neural networks. For example, the forward propagation step begins with observed
$\mathbf{x}$ at the leaves of our computational graph. Propagation proceeds
layer by layer as nodes perform computation once all their children are observed
or have finished computation; as a result, information is propagated through
the network to obtain an output and error.</p>

<p>Precisely, let the inputs to a computational graph representation of an
arbitrary neural network be $n$ nodes labeled $u^{(1)} \dots u^{(n)}$ and its
associated output be $u^{(m)}$. Further let each node compute output $u^{(i)}$
by applying a function $f^{(i)}$ to the set of its parents indexed $j$ such
that $j \in Pa(u^{(i)})$. The forward propagation algorithm proceeds as follows:</p>

<pre id="read-1" style="display:none;">
  
\begin{algorithm}

    \ENDFOR 

    \FOR{$i = n + 1 \dots m$}
    \State $P^{(i)} \gets \{u^{(j)} \mid j \in Pa(u^{(i)})\}$
    \State $u^{(i)} \gets f^{(i)}(P^{(i)})$
    \ENDFOR
\ENDPROCEDURE
\end{algorithmic}

  var options = {
      lineNumber: true
  };
  pseudocode.render(code, parentEl, options);
</script>

<p>We’ll describe backpropagation in a similar vein later in this post.</p>

<h3 id="the-chain-rule-of-calculus">The Chain Rule of Calculus</h3>

<p>The classical chain rule of calculus for one-dimensional variables $x, y, z$ such that
$y = g(x)$ and $z = f(y) = f(g(x))$ states that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx}</script>

<p>In order to work with variables of higher dimension in neural networks, we’ll
need to generalize this beyond the scalar case. Let $\mathbf{x} \in
\mathbf{R}^m, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbf{R}^n, z \in \mathbf{R}$, and let
$\mathbf{y} = g(\mathbf{x})$ and $z = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(g(\mathbf{x}))$ for
appropriately defined $f, g$. The multivariate chain rule<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> states that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\nabla_\mathbf{x} z = \left( \nabla_\mathbf{y} z \right)^T \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \right) \label{multivar}\tag{1}</script>

<p>where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\nabla_\mathbf{y} z = \left[ \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_n} \right]^T</script>

<p>is the gradient of $z$ with respect to $\mathbf{y}$ and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_m} \\
\frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial y_n}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_n}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_n}{\partial x_m} \\
\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>is the Jacobian matrix of $g$ with dimensions $n \times m$. Expanding this
matrix multiplication for the derivative of $z$ with respect to a particular
$x_i$ yields</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial z}{\partial x_i} = \sum_j \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_j} \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_i} \label{scalar}\tag{2}</script>

<p>with the intuitive interpretation that the rate of change of $z$ with respect to
$x_i$ depends on all contributions $y_j$ that $x_i$ influences.</p>

<p><strong>Generalizing to Tensors.</strong> In order to extend the chain rule to tensors (variables with arbitrary
dimension), we can simply flatten each tensor into a vector before running
backpropagation, compute vector-valued gradients, and then reshape the gradient
back to a tensor. In particular, to denote the gradient of $z$ with respect to
tensor $\mathbf{X}$, we write $\nabla_{\mathbf{X}} z$ as if $\mathbf{X}$ were
a flattened vector-representation of $\mathbf{X}$. Indices into $\mathbf{X}$, 
originally tuples of indices across each dimension, can now be represented by
a single variable; for all possible index tuples $i$, $(\nabla_{\mathbf{X}} z)_i$
represents $\frac{\partial z}{\partial X_i}$ where $X_i$ is a single scalar value.
The chain rule for tensors, where $\mathbf{Y} = g(\mathbf{X})$ and $z = f(\mathbf{Y})$,
is therefore</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\nabla_{\mathbf{X}}z = \left( \nabla_{\mathbf{Y}} z \right)^T \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{Y}}{\partial \mathbf{X}} \right)  = \sum_j \frac{\partial z}{\partial Y_j} \left( \nabla_{\mathbf{X}} Y_j \right) \label{tensor}\tag{3}</script>

<p>which is a simple matrix-vector product between the Jacobian $\partial \mathbf{Y} / \partial \mathbf{X}$ and the gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf{Y}} z$.</p>

<h2 id="the-backward-propagation-algorithm">The Backward Propagation Algorithm</h2>

<p>Armed with a computational graph specification and the multivariate chain rule,
we’re now ready to understand backward propagation. Recall that the goal of
backpropagation is to compute derivatives of the output (loss) function with
respect to the parameters of a network. Computing the gradient of a scalar with
respect to any node in the computational graph that produced that scalar is
relatively simple with the chain rule; indeed, backpropagation is an algorithm
that computes the chain rule, but with a specific ordering of operations
specified by the associated computational graph that is highly efficient.</p>

<p>To derive the generalized backpropagation algorithm, we’ll first present a
simplified version on a scalar graph, and build our way to the general approach
accomodating tensor variables.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-scalars">Working with Scalars</h3>

<p>We’ll begin by motivating and presenting the backpropagation algorithm in the
simplified case where all variables in our computational graph are scalars. In
particular, consider a computational graph with $n$ input nodes labeled $u^{(1)}
\dots u^{(n)}$ and output node $u^{(m)}$. To compute the derivative
$\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(j)}}$ for arbitrary node $u^{(j)}$,
the multivariate chain rule (Equation $\ref{scalar}$) yields</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(j)}} = \sum_{i \mid j \in Pa(u^{(i)})} \frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(i)}} \frac{\partial u^{(i)}}{\partial u^{(j)}}</script>

<p>We need to perform this computation for every node in our computational graph,
but how do we do so efficiently? A naive approach would be to simply compute
gradients with respect to nodes $u^{(1)}, u^{(2)}, \dots$ and so on. However,
each gradient computation for nodes at the bottom of the computational graph
would require re-computing gradients for nodes at higher levels of the graph, 
making this process inefficient. More precisely, the naive approach would be
exponential in the number of nodes, which can be seen by writing the multivariate
chain rule explicitly (non-recursively):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(j)}} = \sum_{\text{path } (u^{(\pi_1)},
u^{(\pi_2)}, \dots, u^{(\pi_t)}), \\ \text{ from } \pi_1 = j \text{ to } \pi_t =
m} \prod_{k = 2}^t \frac{\partial u^{(\pi_k)}}{\partial u^{(\pi_k - 1)}}</script>

<p>Instead, backpropagation exploits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic
programming</a> paradigm to
compute gradients in an efficient manner that eliminates the burden of
re-computing common, expensive gradients at each application of the chain
rule.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Instead of starting computation at the bottom of the graph,
backpropagation begins at the output nodes, computing and storing gradients
while traversing through the computational graph in a reverse direction (hence 
the name <em>back</em>propagation).</p>

<p>More precisely, backpropagation operates on a modified computational graph $G’$
which contains exactly one edge $u^{(i)} \to u^{(j)}$ for each edge from node
$u^{(j)} \to u^{(i)}$ of the original graph $G$; this edge is associated with
the computation of $\frac{\partial u^{(i)}}{\partial u^{(j)}}$ and its
multiplication with the gradient already computed for $u^{(i)}$ (that is, $\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(i)}}$). As a result,
each edge in $G’$ computes the blue portion of our earlier expression of the
multivariate chain rule, and the sum of all incoming edges to each node in $G’$
computes the red portion, yielding our desired result.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(j)}} = \color{red}{\sum_{i \mid j \in Pa(u^{(i)})}} \color{blue}{\frac{\partial u^{(m)}}{\partial u^{(i)}} \frac{\partial u^{(i)}}{\partial u^{(j)}}}</script>

<p>This order of operations allows backpropagation to scale linearly with the
number of edges in $G$, avoiding repeated computations. Specifically, to compute
the gradient of an output node with respect to any of its ancestors (say, $a$)
in computational graph $G$, we begin by noting that the gradient of the output
node with respect to itself is 1. We then compute the gradient of the output
node with respect to each of its parents in $G$ by multiplying the current
gradient with the Jacobian of the operation that produced the output (in the
scalar case, this is simply the partial of the output with respect to the
input). We continue doing so, summing gradients for nodes that have multiple
children in $G$, until we reach $a$.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-tensors">Working with Tensors</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed backpropagation in the scalar case, let’s generalize to
tensor-valued nodes. Our logic here will follow the same process summarized at
the end of the prior section, but will employ a bit more formalism to encapsulate
the most general case.</p>

<p>Formally, each node in $G$ will correspond to a variable as before, but we now
allow variables to be tensors (which, in general, can have an arbitrary number
of dimensions). Each variable $V$ is also associated with the operations</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">get_operation(V)</code>, which returns the operation that computes $V$ as
represented by the edges incident on $V$ in $G$.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">get_children(V, G)</code>, which returns the list of children of $V$ in $G$.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">get_parents(V, G)</code>, which returns the list of parents of $V$ in $G$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each operation <code class="highlighter-rouge">op(inputs)</code> returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_operation(V)</code> is associated with a
backpropagation operation <code class="highlighter-rouge">op.bprop(inputs, var, grad)</code> for each of <code class="highlighter-rouge">op</code>’s input
arguments, which computes the Jacobian-gradient product specified in Equation
\ref{tensor}. In particular, <code class="highlighter-rouge">op.bprop(inputs, X, G)</code> returns</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{G}^T \nabla_\mathbf{X} \texttt{op(inputs)} =  \sum_j G_j (\nabla_\mathbf{X} \texttt{op(inputs)}_j )</script>

<p>where $\mathbf{G}$ is the gradient of the final computational graph output
with respect to the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">op</code> and $\mathbf{X}$ is the input variable to <code class="highlighter-rouge">op</code>
which we are computing gradients with respect to.</p>

<p>As a quick example to solidify intuition, let <code class="highlighter-rouge">op(inputs = [A, B]) =</code> $AB$ be the
matrix product of two tensors $A$ and $B$. This operation also defines</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">op.bprop(inputs, A, G) = </code> $A^TG$</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">op.bprop(inputs, B, G) = </code> $GB^T$</li>
</ul>

<p>which specify the gradients of the operation with respect to each of the inputs.
Note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">op</code> must treat each of its inputs as distinct, even if $A = B$; this
is because these individual gradients will eventually be added to obtain the
correct total.</p>

<p>The formal backpropagation algorithm thus proceeds as follows.</p>

<p>Note that lines 6 - 11 operate in a backwards propagating manner as previously
described; no gradients are computed until a previously known gradient is obtained
(which is initially only the output node of the graph), and subsequent computations
proceed backward along $G’$, summing computations for the children of $V$ until
the final gradient is computed (and stored in the gradient table for later calls). 
This table-filling aspect of backpropagation which allows the algorithm to avoid
repeating common subexpressions is what makes it a dynamic programming approach.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-further-considerations">Conclusion and Further Considerations</h2>

<p>Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm for the computation of gradients of
variables in computational graphs in a highly efficient manner. When coupled
with an optimization algorithm (often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic gradient
descent</a>) for adjusting
parameters based on their gradients with respect to an output, backpropagation
enables the fast and efficient training of an amalgam of neural networks. It
does so by following the dynamic programming paradigm to store intermediate
gradients in a table and performing computations backwards in the computational
graph, thereby avoiding the exponential complexity of a naive approach and instead
requiring linear time in the number of edges in the graph.</p>

<p>While the algorithm described in this post is general (and is similar to the
<a href="https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/differentiation-in-pytorch/63881/3">symbol-to-number</a>
approach employed in PyTorch), it papers over many complexities that arise when
designing real-world generalized backpropagation routines. Indeed, our approach
only applies to operations that return a single tensor; many implementations
must allow for operations to return more than one tensor. Additionally, while
backpropagation reduces the time complexity of gradient computation, it comes
with a linear memory cost, which can be prohibitive in large comuptational
graphs. The solutions to these and other subtelties are at the core of libraries
such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, which are able to enable gradient computation at
scale.</p>
