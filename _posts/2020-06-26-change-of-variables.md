title: "A (Formal) Probabilistic Interpretation of Linear Regression"
subtitle: Linear regression is a prolific and natural algorithm often justified
          probabilistically by assuming that the error in the relationship between
          target and input variables is Gaussian. Here, I provide a formal proof
          of this justification.
