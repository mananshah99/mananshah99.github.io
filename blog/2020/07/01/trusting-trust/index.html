        <p>Ken Thompson’s “Reflections on Trusting Trust” <a class="citation" href="#thompson1984reflections">(Thompson, 1984)</a> is a short and effective paper discussing a fascinating exploit and its
implications on trust in computer security. The following is based on the
aforementioned paper as well as discussions
<a href="https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/04/15/strange-loops-dennis-ritchie-a">here</a>
and
<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/184874/is-ken-thompsons-compiler-hack-still-a-threat?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Consider the C compiler, which is bootstrapped and written in C.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> For
simplicity, let the compiler routine be represented as follows.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compile (code)
{
  /* Do regular compilation things */
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Unix kernel has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">login</code> command that accepts an encrypted password and
compares it to the stored user password in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/password</code>, allowing access on a
match and rejecting access otherwise. Say we wanted to insert a backdoor into
this command, which would accept either the encrypted password or a particular
known password we would like to inject. Doing so would allow a third-party user
to gain access to any system with this additional password.</p>

<h3 id="a-trivial-backdoor">A Trivial Backdoor</h3>

<p>At the time that Thampson wrote his article, most Unix users compiled elements
of their system on heterogeneous hardware (binary distributions were less
common than they are today). The C compiler thus assumed a privileged position
as a centerpiece in this workflow.</p>

<p>As a naive attempt to insert such a backdoor, we can consider modifying the C
compiler to compile the backdoor instead of the traditional login code when the
login code is being compiled, but behave normally in all other situations. In
pseudocode, our modification might look like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compile (code)
{
  /* If the code we're compiling is code for the Unix login command */
  if (match (code, login_code_pattern))
  {
    compile (backdoor);
    return;
  }

  else
  {
    /* Do regular compilation things */
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would work perfectly, so that whenever the Unix kernel was compiled,
the code generated by the compiler would include our desired backdoor. However,
our exploit isn’t fooling anyone: a simple look at the C compiler source code
would immediately raise complaints.</p>

<h3 id="thompsons-exploit">Thompson’s Exploit</h3>

<p>In the previous scenario, our modification to the compiler’s source code was
poorly received, as a third party could easily verify the maliciousness of the
source code. However, the buck doesn’t stop at the source code—Thompson’s
exploit and article build on the notion that building executables places
implicit trust in many other, less known components of the build system that
often fly under the radar.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the C compiler. Imagine an exploit that modifies the
compiler with a malicious program that is executed <em>when the compiler compiles
itself</em>. In particular, when the compiler is asked to compile itself, it
instead compiles a version of itself with the login backdoor <em>and</em> the malicious
program inserted. To summarize, our compiler now includes two new procedures, 
which we together call the “malicious program”: <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<ol>
  <li>If asked to compile the Unix kernel login code, it instead compiles the
backdoor code</li>
  <li>If asked to compile itself, it instead compiles a version of itself with both
the logic in (1) and the logic that enables (2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that for procedure (2) to work properly, the malicious program that the
compiler executes when asked to compile itself must be able to print its own
source code, so that it can insert its source code into the modified code to be
compiled. Programs that can do so are called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quines</a>.</p>

<p>Our resulting compiler looks like</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compile (code)
{
  /* If the code we're compiling is code for the Unix login command */
  if (match (code, login_code_pattern))
  {
    compile (backdoor);
    return;
  }

  /* If the code we're compiling is the compiler source code */
  if (match (code, compiler_code_pattern))
  {
    compile (compiler_code_with_both_if_statements_inserted);
    return;
  }

  else
  {
    /* Do regular compilation things */
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, when we compile the C compiler with itself, we obtain a binary that
includes the code to insert a backdoor upon compilation of the Unix kernel login
command. Cleaning up, we can finally delete our modifications to the compiler
code, so that we leave no trace of our exploit; however, the exploit code
remains within the binary of the C compiler—and when the compiler compiles
itself, the code will be re-introduced!</p>

<p>In other words, since the C compiler compiles itself, any future (perfectly
exploit-free) version of the C compiler <em>that is compiled by our poisoned binary</em>
will include the backdoor due to procedure (2). And, if the Unix kernel is
compiled by our poisoned binary, it will include the login backdoor, as
desired.</p>

<h3 id="implications-on-bootstrapping-trust">Implications on Bootstrapping Trust</h3>

<p>Thompson’s exploit is initially quite worrying: if you can’t trust the C
compiler, and you can’t trust the compiler binary, what do you do? You can
re-build the compiler binary, but you can’t trust the binary you used to
re-build… and so on, in an indefinite loop of recursive paranoia.</p>

<p>Indeed, the particular exploit is less important than the principle it conveys:
trusting nobody is a fool’s errand. Regardless of the layer of the stack you
are developing, it’s worth keeping in mind what your trust model <em>truly</em> is,
both in the direct contracts you form (<em>e.g.</em> the written code) and the
indirect/implied contracts that are formed against lower layers of the stack.</p>

<p>In Thompson’s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In demonstrating the possibility of this attack, I picked on the C compiler. I
could have picked on any program-handling program such as an assembler, a
loader, or even hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these
bugs will be harder and harder to detect. A well-installed microcode bug will
be almost impossible to detect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

      <p>How does this work? Certainly, the first-ever version of a compiler for
new language $L$ cannot be written in $L$. However, one can <em>bootstrap</em> the
process by first writing a compiler for language $L$ in existing language
$E$ (call this $C_E$),then writing a compiler for $L$ in $L$ itself (and
compiling this compiler with $C_E$ to get $C_L$), and from then onwards
using $C_L$ to compile future versions of $L$. For some more discussion,
see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38005656/how-can-a-compiler-compile-itself/38005659#38005659">this StackOverflow

      <p>Technically, both of these steps require solving the Halting problem —
to determine whether two sources do the same thing, you’d have to prove
that they both halt in the same circumstances — but a semantically
similar match for login/compiler source code is likely enough in practice. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
